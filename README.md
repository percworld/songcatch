# Setlift - [view deployed site](https://setlift.herokuapp.com/)

Voyage into a band's history and get updated as they grow using this setlist-generating app that consumes the phantasy tour API. You may take a look at a tour and choose a show and have a setlist generated. If you see a song you like, explore it further for details and performances. You keep an active tab of your favorite songs so you can stay in the loop with your favorite artist's performances or *reminisce* about a past musical and friendship experience.

## Tech utilized:
* Node
* React Router and hooks
* Cypress for testing
* Express

## Future Extensions:
1. Image Component for dynamic image rendering for top twenty bands.
2. Setlist submission to group for sharing / user comparison and collection

## Learning goals and project evolution:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was committed to learning express at some point and this project gave me the initiative to build an express module based on my learnings.  Reading through the materials and documents regarding services was eye-opening and got me *excited* about joining the backend for my next two projects.  The goal was to use Express and bypass CORS authorization before any work could be done to build out a framework to utilize the API.  It is evident that the more practice I can get in this area will greatly improve my understanding of networking.  


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the project, utilizing the many new skills I learned in mod3 was the impetus and I got some great practice in , as was revealed to myself by my comfort level in coding in React.  The goal in this project was making a dashboard that looked inviting and operated simply but elegantly, unlike the API's host webUrl I took a deeper dive into Sass styling to control scrolling correctly and utilize svg's by destructuring a React Component created from the file.
